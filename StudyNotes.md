# Setting up a Powerful API with NodeJS, GraphQL, MongoDB, Hapi, and Swagger 

Separating the frontend and backend of any application has many advantages: 

* The main reason why reusable APIs are popular, **Support for any client** - APIs allow the user to
  consume data from a web client, mobile app, desktop app, etc (any client really) 

* **Separation of concerns**. Gone are the days where we have one monolithic app where everything is 
  bundled together. Imagine we have an extremely convoluted application. The only option then is to
  hire extremely experienced/senior developers due to the natural complexity

If we are to hire juniors (that's me!) and have room for training staff then we need to have our 
concerns separated so each party can focus on their **microservices**. 

<br>

> With separation of concerns, developers can reduce the complexity of the application by splitting 
> responsibilities into `microservices` where each team is specialized in their micro-service

<br> 

The **on-boarding/ramp-up process is much quicker** thanks to splitting up responsibilities (backend
team, frontend team, dev ops team, and so on)
